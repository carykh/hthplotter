Head-to-head ao5 plotter for speedcubing. It's also online here: https://htwins.net/hthplotter/

I started coding this on a 5-hour plane ride from San Francisco to Toronto on the way to Rubik's WCA North American Championships 2022. I then finished it over the next 4 days of the competition, and it was shown during finals round of that very competition! (Thanks to Keaton Ellis and Mitchell Lane for getting that to happen.)

I would not be surprised if there are still bugs with the math and UI. This was very much a minimum viable product to demonstrate a concept! In fact, making this really felt like a participating in a hackathon. Anyway, feel free to fork this repo and create your own interesting variations of it.
